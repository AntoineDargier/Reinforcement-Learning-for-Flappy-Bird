# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Flappy-Bird
Reinforcement learning course, CentraleSup√©lec, Summer 2023

### Goal
Implementation of two agents to play Flappy Bird Game

### Language
```Python```

### Contents
1. Random agent
2. Q-Learning agent
3. Expected Sarsa agent
4. Pipeline and training
5. State Value plot
6. Parameters fine-tuning

### Libraries
* ```gymnasium```
* ```scipy```
* ```numpy```
* ```matplotlib```

### Conclusion
In this project, I have seen that I am able to develop two reinforcement learning agents that can play Flappy Bird. In our case, the Q-Learning agent seems to perform a little better than Expected Sarsa. In fact, its state value function seems more logical and it performs better results for different values of the step size and of the discount parameter. With a little work to develop a detector on the real game, our pipeline seems good to be used on the real game.
